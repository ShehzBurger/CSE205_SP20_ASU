        1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

        -If a software engineer finds a bug in a piece of code for a product that will go out to the public
        in a matter of weeks, then they have a duty to fix the bugs as the public will be using broken code if they do not.

        2. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

        -If an Android OS develepor finds flaws within his/her custom OS, it is their responsibility to solve the flaw, which
        may include stability issues, performance issues and bugs in the system. The product must be in the best condition it can
        be in or else the develepor is not fulfilling his/her duty.

        3. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

        -Software engineers are not obligated to share their code with anyone, but it is their duty to help and support their colleagues.
        For example, if an engineer sees someone in their workplace who is struggling, in order to adhere to the code, they should
        provide some assistance to them.

        4. PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

        -In order to protect the reputation and integrity of their professional workplace, software engineers need
        to do whatever it takes to fulfill their customers' needs. For example, in an Apple store, if someone comes in with
        a bootlooping iPhone, it is the Apple worker's job to figure out what to do to uphold the company's status.class

        5. MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

        -There always needs to be leaders among a team and that is no different in software engineering. For example if a team does not know what UI
        design choices to make, a software engineer needs to take charge and make the decision. This will make for a clearer path for future design choices
        and make it easier for the team to work together in the future.
